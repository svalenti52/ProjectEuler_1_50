## 2 Even Fibonacci Numbers

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,...

> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

1. Loop over increasing indices to the Fibonacci sequence contained in a vector; the vector initially has {1, 2} in it and is extended
by using the recurrence relation F[i] = F[i-2] + F[i-1]. Break from the loop when F[i] exceeds 4,000,000.
	1. Test each F[i] calculated and put in fibo_even if it is even. Note: fibo_even is initialized with 2; 
	subsequent numbers are evaluated for inclusion.
2. Calculate the sum of the fibo_even elements.
