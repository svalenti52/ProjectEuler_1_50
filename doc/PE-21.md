## 21 Amicable Numbers

> Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a != b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b
are called amicable numbers.

> For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. 
The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 71, and 142; so d(284) = 220.

> Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10,000.

This problem is looking for pairs of distinct numbers whose proper divisors sum to the other number in the pair.

Using a set as a container to store amicable numbers is a simple way of avoiding duplication.

Algorithm is straightforward:

1. Loop on incrementing sopd_1 as a try for the first number of the pair, ranging from 4 to 10,000.
	1. Calculate sopd_2 as a sum_of_proper_divisors of sopd_1.
	2. If sopd_1 == sopd_2 continue with the loop (skip the last step).
	2. Store in Amicable_Numbers set if sopd_1 == sum_of_proper_divisors(sopd_2).
2. Calculate the sum of members of Amicable_Numbers set.
