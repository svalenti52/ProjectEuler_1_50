## 41 Pandigital Prime

> We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits to exactly once. For example, 2143 is a
4-digit pandigital and is also prime.
What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

This problem is made less computationally intensive by recognizing that there no 8-digit or 9-digit pandigital primes.
It is simple to determine that all 8-digit and 9-digit pandigital numbers are divisible by 3.

1. Loop over 3-digit to 7-digit length pandigital numbers inclusive.
	1. Loop over permutations of the digits of each pandigital number.
		1. Test for primality and store in a vector **primes** if prime.
	2. Select the maximal element from the **primes** vector.
2. The maximal element returned for the greatest digit length to have a non-empty **primes** vector is the solution.
